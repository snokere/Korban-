TRADITIONAL PRACTICES - INSTRUMENTS FOR ECONOMIC ABUSE AGAINST WOMEN. 
Some traditional practices by some ethnic groups in some African countries had done no good but harm to women’s economic development in most of the rural communities. These traditional practices have negatively affected the fundamental rights of women. They include unreasonable deprivation of economic or financial resources entitled to these women, harmful widowhood practices and denial of inheritance or succession rights among others.
It is so unfortunate that many women have been trapped into these traditional practices either by birth or by marriage in African communities where the traditions of the people do not allow women to own properties in their own names while their husbands are alive, some are not even allowed to inherit properties or successions of their late husbands or late parents in other cases. The men are assumed to be the only ones who have the rights to succession, inheritance and ownership to properties such as land, houses and other assets. In most cases where a woman loses her husband, she is forced to leave the family without any possession of her husband’s assets either because she did not give birth to children or she did not give birth to a male child for the man, whom they assumed should have rightfully inherited her late husband’s properties. In some cases even when the women gives birth to both female and male children, she is still not allowed to inherit what belonged to her late husband and she is forcefully sent out of the family with her children according to the tradition. There are other cases too where a woman is not allowed to make decisions in her own home after the death of her husband. The man’s family makes every decision for the woman on how she should run her own home, what she should do and what not to do. The woman is said to have no voice in the family and by the time you know it she stands to loose everything she had laboured with her late husband for so many years and ends up with nothing for she and her children. Perhaps the woman was left with five or more children by her late husband, the question is how would she train and cater for the children’s welfare and education? 
This brings us to another negative effect of the economic abuse against women and that is the fact that the rights to welfare and education of children are violated as a result of these unreasonable tradition and cultural practices of the people. The fact that this woman has lost all the inheritance of her late husband might indirectly cause the society lots of problems as such – her children may end up becoming illiterates or nuisance to their community; they may even end up becoming terrorist if she does not have any other means of providing for the children’s welfare and education . With these, we can also trace the high rate of insurgency to these traditional practices. 
Another negative effect this economic abuse against women may also bring to any community is economic devaluation. Women are said to be great contributors to economic development of any Nation as the slogan says ‘’Empower the woman, build a Nation’’. Most of these communities had not only reduced their opportunities for economic growth which has been identified as one of the most important factors in helping to reduce poverty but they have also increased the rate of poverty in the community. Despite the women’s contributions to the national economy, they had also gotten less benefits of economic growth due to gender inequality evolving from these traditional practices. Looking at the roles women play in contributing to the development of the nation, I want to categorically state that women do not deserved to be economically abused in any way. Women should be supported, economically empowered, the voice of the women should echo in the ‘’ears of the government and traditional rulers’’ and priorities should be given to the economic development of women and above all, their rights to ownership of properties, inheritance and succession should be respected and not violated. 
Therefore, traditional leaders, religious leaders, civil society organization, women and men organizations, the government and private sectors, local and international stakeholders must give priorities to the economic development of Women. We must rise to fight against every form of economic abuse against women by breaking all chains of gender inequality. Our lawmakers and executive arm of government are equally the hope of these women; they must therefore justify the trust reposed on them by establishing and enforcing laws respectively that will stand against all practices set to enhance economic abuse against women. The voice of every woman must be heard. Ones again with much emphasizes on the Community Based Organizations (CSOs) and other Civil Society Organization (CSOs) focusing on rural communities, all hands must be put on desk, commit your organizations to capacity buildings for the rural women, amplify their voices, strengthen their mental, social, political and economic capacities with advocacy trainings and economic empowerments. 
Finally, I call on the women in the rural communities, rise up in unity with one voice, let your Nation hear your voice, as you say ‘’NO TO WOMEN ECONOMIC ABUSE’’. You have the weapon to fight this fight and that weapon is your ‘’VOICE’’ and you equally have all it takes to be economic empowered, being sole owners of land, houses and other properties because you have the RIGHT. Therefore rise up to this challenge with a new slogan which says ‘’WOMEN ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT, THE STRENGTH OF ALL WOMEN’’.
